# UniDec Data Processing

This script is intended to provide a simple function to aggregate "mass.txt" files from multiple UniDec processed Thermo .raw files that would exist in as many subfolders into a single destination folder. The output is intended to provide a means to enable uploading processed intensity vs mass (Da) csv file into the Scinamic ELN system.
